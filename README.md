### Requirements:

Requirements for the Rmd files are given within each script, or can be installed in advance using:

```
in which the list of packages used is given.

Requirements for the Python code is given in `requirements.txt`; to install, in a virtual environment run:

```

## Evidence

Our working is shown in our own directories,

* assessment1.Rmd
* Logistic Regression Model.ipynb
* Ass 1 Work.Rmd

Yifan and Hugh wrote the R analysis, Jiaqi and Revati wrote the Python analysis. Data and Intro was written by Hugh, and Wrapup together after examination of the whole analysis.
