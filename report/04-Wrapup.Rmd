## Wrapup

Through different EDA methods we have allocated a time series to the data and found a general trend that could be used to poise hypotheses towards the data.

We have also been able to test the data against different accruacy measures for plotting.

## Conclusion

Sources such as Kaggle and GitHub are reliable for extracting and manipulating code for EDA on environmental datasets.
