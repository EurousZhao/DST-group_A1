## The brief



## The team



## Library requirements

  ! Lib requiremnts should be provided further in individual analyses

We need `fs` to be able to handle directories in a cross-platform way. This makes the whole analysis much more repeatable and is good data science practice.

```{r}
if (!require("fs")) install.packages("fs")
library("fs")
```

## The data



## Get the data

First create a directory for it to go in:
```{r}
rawdatadir=path_wd("..","data","raw")
if(!dir.exists(rawdatadir)) dir.create(rawdatadir,recursive = TRUE)
```

Download it
```{r}
download.file("https://github.com/dsbristol/dst/raw/master/data/conn_sample.log",path_wd("..","data","raw","conn_sample.log"))
```

Load the data:
```{r}
data <- read.table(path_wd("..","data","raw","smoking_driking_dataset.csv"),header=TRUE, sep = ",")
```

Quick peak at the data:
```{r}
head(data)
summary(data)
```
